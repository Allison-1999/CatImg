# CatImg
In this course design, I used python3.7, used OpenCV to process the image, and used Tkinter to implement the GUI. Finally, I programmed a simple image preprocessing application. The application can complete the following functions: read the basic information of the image, such as width, height, number of channels, etc.; convert GRB images into grayscale (GRAY) images; perform basic transformations on the image, including rotating any angle, in x and y Shift in direction and scale proportionally; to achieve gray-level transformation of gray-scale images, you can choose 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 and 128 gray-scale layers; to perform histogram equalization on gray-scale images ; To smooth the image, the application uses mean filtering; to extract the edge of the image, the application uses the sobel operator. The processed images will be saved in the folder.

How to use?
